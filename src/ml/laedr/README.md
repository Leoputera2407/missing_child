## Getting Started
Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/High_Performance_Face_Recognition/edit/master/src/Look%20Across%20Elapse-%20Disentangled%20Representation%20Learning%20and%20Photorealistic%20Cross-Age%20Face%20Synthesis%20for%20Age-Invariant%20Face%20Recognition.TensorFlow.git
```

Download the UTKFace data ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T5KH-DWXu048im0xBuRK0WEi820T28B-/view?usp=sharing), [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12Qp5pdZvitqBYSJHm4ouOw)), put into the "data" folder, and run ```python train_main.py```.
